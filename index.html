            <p class="question-number">AUD Question 1</p>
            <p class="question-text">A government internal audit function is presumed to be free from organizational independence impairments for reporting internally when the head of the organization</p>
            <div class="options">
                <p>A. Is not accountable to those charged with governance.</p>
                <p>B. Performs auditing procedures that are consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
                <p>C. Is a line-manager of the unit under audit.</p>
                <p>D. Is removed from political pressure to conduct audits objectively, without fear of political reprisal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: D</p>
                <p class="explanation">Organizational independence for a government internal audit function is best achieved when its head is removed from political pressures. This allows the internal auditors to report objectively and without fear of reprisal, ensuring their findings are unbiased.</p>

                <p>B. Independent for purposes of examining financial information required to be filed annually with the DOL.</p>
                <p>C. Included on the list of firms approved by the DOL.</p>
                <p>D. Independent of the utility company and NOT relying on its services.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: B</p>
                <p class="explanation">The Department of Labor (DOL) requires that the auditor of an employee benefit plan be independent for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the financial statements filed with the DOL under ERISA. This independence is specifically outlined in the DOL's rules.</p>

            <div class="options">
                <p>A. The Badger audit firm audits ABC Co., a publicly traded company. Tam is on Badger's audit team for the audit. His sister is a direct report of the CFO of ABC.</p>
                <p>B. The Otter audit firm audits XYZ Co., a publicly traded company. Tim was on Otter's audit team for the audit last year, but just a few days after last year's audit was completed, Tim severed all ties with Otter and went to work as the controller at XYZ.</p>
                <p>C. The Weasel audit firm audits LMN Co., a publicly traded company. LMN's audit cycle runs from January 1 to December 31. Tom was on Weasel's audit team for the 2016 audit. He severed all ties with Weasel on March 1, 2017. Tom went to work in a significant accounting position at LMN on January 2, 2019.</p>
                <p>D. The Possum audit firm audits PQR Co., a publicly traded company. Max is lead partner on the PQR audit team. Max's sister Estrella is CFO of PQR. Max and his sister are estranged.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C</p>
                <p class="explanation">SOX and SEC rules require a one-year "cooling-off" period before a former audit team member can take on a key financial reporting oversight role at an audit client. If a former auditor has served this required cooling-off period, their subsequent employment in such a role does not impair the firm's independence.</p>

                <p>C. Burt, the lead partner for the ABC Co. audit at Sarah's firm.</p>
                <p>D. All of the options.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: D</p>
                <p class="explanation">Under SEC independence rules, "covered persons" are individuals whose financial relationships with an audit client are restricted. This includes members of the audit engagement team, partners who provide non-audit services to the audit client, as well as firm leadership who can influence the audit.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <p class="question-number">AUD Question 5</p>
            <p class="question-text">Sue's firm was hired to audit a Reno County project that used federal grant money. When the chief administrator heard about Sue's preliminary findings, he threatened that her firm would lose every audit contract with every unit of Reno County government if he was not pleased with Sue's audit report. This is an example of:</p>
            <div class="options">
                <p>A. A potential personal impairment of independence.</p>
                <p>B. A potential external impairment of independence.</p>

                <p>D. None of the above.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: B</p>
                <p class="explanation">This scenario represents an external impairment to independence. External impairments occur when conditions or pressures from outside the audit organization prevent the auditor from carrying out the audit work and reporting the results impartially. A threat of losing future contracts due to an unfavorable audit report is a classic example of such external pressure.</p>

            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C</p>
                <p class="explanation">In AICPA professional standards, "should" indicates a presumptively mandatory requirement. The auditor must comply unless they can demonstrate that the alternative course of action taken was sufficient to achieve the objectives of the requirement. "Must" or "is required" indicates an unconditional requirement.</p>

                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A</p>
                <p class="explanation">Interpretive publications are recommendations on the application of Statements on Auditing Standards (SASs). SAS appendices are part of the SAS themselves, which are primary authoritative literature, not interpretive publications about the SAS.</p>

            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: D</p>
                <p class="explanation">The engagement letter formalizes the agreement between the auditor and client. A crucial element is to clearly define the scope and limitations of the audit, including that an audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance and may not detect all material misstatements, especially those resulting from fraud.</p>

                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C</p>
                <p class="explanation">The engagement letter is the formal written agreement between the auditor and the client. It outlines the terms and objectives of the engagement, the responsibilities of both management and the auditor, the scope of the audit, and the expected form and content of reports.</p>

            <div class="options">
                <p>A. Make a preliminary judgment about materiality.</p>
                <p>B. Confirm a sample of the entity's accounts payable with known creditors.</p>

                <p>D. Communicate management's initial selection of accounting policies to the audit committee.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A</p>
                <p class="explanation">Making a preliminary judgment about materiality is a critical step in the audit planning phase. This judgment guides the auditor in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures. Confirming accounts payable and obtaining management representations are typically performed during fieldwork and completion stages.</p>

        <div class="question-block">

            </div>
            <div class="answer-box">
                <p class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A</p>
                <p class="explanation">A lower AR turnover ratio indicates that accounts receivable are being collected more slowly or that the AR balance is unusually high relative to sales. Fictitious credit sales would inflate the accounts receivable balance without corresponding cash collections, thus lowering the AR turnover ratio.</p>

The alternate valuation date was validly elected by the executor of Fred's estate. Fred's estate included 2,000 shares of listed stock for which Fred's basis was $380,000. This stock was distributed to Ida nine months after Fred's death.

Since the stock was distributed nine months after death (after the 6-month mark), the AVD value is the 6-month FMV of $450,000.</p>
